 And we know that all things work together for¬
good to them that love God, to them who are the¬
called according to his purpose.
 For whom he did foreknow, he also did¬
predestinate to be conformed to the image of his¬
Son, that he might be the firstborn among many¬
brethren.
 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also¬
called: and whom he called, them he also¬
justified: and whom he justified, them he also¬
glorified.
 What shall we then say to these things? If God be¬
for us, who can be against us?
 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him¬
up for us all, how shall he not with him also¬
freely give us all things?
 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's¬
elect? It is God that justifieth.
 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that¬
died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even¬
at the right hand of God, who also maketh¬
intercession for us.
 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?¬
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or¬
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all¬
the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the¬
slaughter.
 Nay, in all these things we are more than¬
conquerors through him that loved us.
 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life,¬
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor¬
things present, nor things to come,
 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,¬
shall be able to separate us from the love of God,¬
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
